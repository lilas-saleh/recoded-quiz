            <h3>How To Stay Focused In A World Full Of Distractions</h3>
            <p>Set up your day the night before, do the most difficult things first, 
             eliminate distractions and time wasters, regenerate and keep up your energy, 
             make a daily to-do list, and constantly remind yourself of your 
             ultimate goals.</p>

            <h3>How to keep your mind health </h3>
            <p>Aim for 150 minutes or more of aerobic exercise each week. If you’ve not been moving regularly, don’t worry. 
                Merrill pointed out that one study found sedentary older adults who participated in a new habit of walking 
                regularly for one year showed significant improvements in memory performance that also related to growth of 
                memory areas in the brain.
                Moreover, anxiety and stress take a toll on your mental health, but they can also impact your physical and 
                brain health, too. Regular meditation or a mindfulness practice may help reduce the risk of worsening vascular health.
                Additionally, check your blood pressure regularly, or at least every six months. Watch for signs of a creeping increase.</p>
